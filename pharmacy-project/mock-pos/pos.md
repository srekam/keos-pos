# POS Frontend Design Requirements

Design a modern and clean Point of Sale (POS) frontend interface using Tailwind CSS. 
Focus only on the sales process (the backend is already implemented). 
The UI should include the following screens:

## 1. Login / Shift Open
- Simple login form (username + password or PIN)
- Option to start a shift and enter opening cash balance

## 2. POS Main Screen
- Product search (by barcode input, text search, or category buttons)
- Product grid with images and quick add button
- Shopping cart area showing selected items, quantity, price, and total
- Buttons for editing cart (increase/decrease qty, remove item)
- Checkout button

## 3. Checkout / Payment
- Display order summary with subtotal, tax, discount, and total
- Payment method options: Cash, Card, QR
- For cash: input amount received and calculate change
- Confirm payment button
- Option to print or send e-receipt

## 4. (Optional) Refund Screen
- Input or scan receipt number
- Select items to refund
- Confirm refund

## 5. Shift Close
- Input counted cash balance
- Show sales summary
- Confirm closing shift

## Design Requirements

The design should look like a professional POS system: 
- Large buttons and clear typography for quick access
- A responsive layout (tablet or desktop view)
- Clean modern style with a focus on usability in a retail or restaurant environment.
